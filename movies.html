    <p>The Movie, <i>i, Robot</i> always scared me as a kid. The movie takes place in 2032, which I always thought was so unrealistic.
    "No way we'll have AI robots by then!!!" But I was wrong...</p>

    <p><i>The Pursuit of Hapyness</i> makes me happy. Super emotional. Such a great movie </p>

    <p><i>Independence Day</i> was too long. Also, they didn;t play the mystery part of it hard enough imo. Revealing the creatures kinda
    took away the mystery of the aliens.</p>
